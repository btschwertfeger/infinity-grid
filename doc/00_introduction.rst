üó∫Ô∏è Overview
-----------

The infinity-grid is a trading algorithm that uses grid trading strategies that
places buy and sell orders in a grid-like manner, while following the principle
of buying low and selling high. It is designed for trading cryptocurrencies,
stocks, and derivatives on various exchanges, initially only supporting
`Kraken`_ Spot exchange with plans to expand to other major exchanges, is
written in Python and currently uses the `python-kraken-sdk`_ library to
interact with the Kraken API, with additional exchange adapters planned.

The algorithm requires a PostgreSQL or SQLite database and is designed to be run
in a container. The algorithm can be configured to use different trading
strategies, such as :ref:`GridHODL <strategies-gridhodl-section>`,
:ref:`GridSell <strategies-gridsell-section>`, :ref:`SWING
<strategies-swing-section>`, and :ref:`cDCA <strategies-cdca-section>`.

The algorithm requires a PostgreSQL or SQLite database and is designed to be run
in a container. The algorithm can be configured to use different trading
strategies, such as GridHODL, GridSell, SWING, and cDCA. While the verbosity
levels of logging provide useful insights into the algorithms's behavior, the
custom notification channels such as Telegram can be used to receive updates on
the algorithms's activity.

Note: This project is the successor of the `kraken-infinity-grid`_.

üö® Troubleshooting
------------------

- Only use release versions of the ``infinity-grid``. The ``master``
  branch might contain unstable code! Also pin the the dependencies used in
  order to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Check the **permissions of your API keys** and the required permissions on the
  respective endpoints of your chosen exchange.
- If you get some Cloudflare or **rate limit errors**, please check your tier
  level on your exchange and maybe apply for a higher rank if required.
- **Use different API keys for different algorithms**, because the nonce
  calculation of exchanges is often based on timestamps and a sent nonce must
  always be the highest nonce ever sent of that API key. Having multiple
  algorithms using the same keys will result in invalid nonce errors. This also
  avoids rate limitation of individual keys.
- Exchanges often have **maintenance windows**. Please check the status page of
  your exchange for more information.
- When encountering errors like "Could not find order '...'. Retry 3/3 ...",
  this might be due to the **exchange API being slow**. The algorithm will retry
  the request up to three times before raising an exception. If the order is
  still not available, just restart the algorithm - or let this be handled by
  Docker compose to restart the container automatically. Then the order will
  most probably be found.
- Always use unique user reference keys/numbers for each trading bot instance.
  The algorithm will know what orders to handle based on passed user reference
  numbers and selected trading pair.
- Feel free to open an issue at `infinity-grid/issues`_.
